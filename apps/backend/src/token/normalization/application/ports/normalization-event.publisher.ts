/**
 * @deprecated Moved to apps/kol-calls/src/normalization/ (Tramo 1, todo 7 + P18 companion).
 * Normalization as mention-index now lives in kol-calls: NormalizeCallUseCase →
 * (contract, kol, messageId) index WITHOUT collapse ("one card per coin" explicitly
 * derogated per P1). This file stays wired for dual-run; it will be removed in
 * todo 16 (cutover + cleanup). Do not extend it — add normalization logic in
 * apps/kol-calls/src/normalization/ instead.
 *
 * New location: apps/kol-calls/src/normalization/
 * Reason: extracting KOL pipeline from backend monolith to dedicated app
 * Breaking change: Yes (removal in todo 16)
 * Rollback: re-enable backend path (KOL_PIPELINE_ENABLED=true)
